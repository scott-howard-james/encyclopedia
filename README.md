An Encyclopedia is an abstract container intended for smallish data sets which provides many of the benefits of a relational (and non-relational) database, but with lower syntactic friction. In particular, an Encyclopedia uses arithmetic expressions typical of first-class objects (e.g. lists, dictionaries) to perform common dataset operations such as merging and subsetting. Encyclopedia supports functional composition, enabling modifications to entire Encyclopedias in a single statement, similar to data frame vectorization.
